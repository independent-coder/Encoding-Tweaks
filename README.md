### Conclusion

Well, bye, guys! I love doing small projects like this, and after completing a bigger program. Also, I'm working on a suite of little Python programs with a name and tweaks, so this repo is part of it, and the other hashing tweaks are also a part of it. There will be a Tool-Tweaks website available soon. Ciao, everyone!
